Let me ask you two questions.  What is the answer to life?  What is the answer to the universe?  What is interesting is that this sentence isn't a question.  Of course, you already knew that--we assume.  What is the best way to handle a sentence with a semicolon; is it simply to ignore what follows the semicolon?  Thankfully, it's all right if that last answer didn't come out right. After all, no oracle is perfect. What is?  Oh, and one more question.  What is not the answer?  Sorry, we couldn't resist messing with your oracle.
